# Hotellivaraus Järjestelmä
Simple Hotel booking system

## How it Works
First the program draws how many rooms there is in the hotel between 42 - 300 rooms.
Then it shows menu for user where user can select 1 - 4
1. Tee uusi varaus. (make a new reservation)
2. Peru varaus. (Cancel reservation)
3. Tarkastele varauksiasi. (check your reservations)
4. Lopeta ohjelma. (exit program)

Program runs until hotel is fully booked or user exits.
